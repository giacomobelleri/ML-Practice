# Machine Learning Practice Repository
## Goal of This Repository
This repository contains all files developed while practicing and understanding Machine Learning concepts and algorithms. For more information, contact: [giacomo.belleri@epfl.ch](mailto:giacomo.belleri@epfl.ch?subject=ML-Practice%20Information)

## Status of The Project
The project is currently on standby as it is being replaced by the ``Machine Learning For Physicists'' course provided by EPFL's MSc Physics program.
The project will be updated with new code when necessary.

## What Is In This Repository? 
In this repository, one can find pdf files of articles, books, and other resources under the "Resources" folder.
In addition, my notes written in LaTeX can be found in the "Notes" folder or at the following [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tgzqsyzycmbn#c14c5e) (read-only).
